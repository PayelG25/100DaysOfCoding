// In this challenge, you must read an integer, a double, and a String from stdin, then print the values according to the instructions in the Output Format section below.
// To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor.

// Note: We recommend completing Java Stdin and Stdout I before attempting this challenge.

// Input Format

// There are three lines of input:

 //  1. The first line contains an integer.
 //  2. The second line contains a double.
 //  3. The third line contains a String.
  
// Output Format

// There are three lines of output:

  // 1. On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
  // 2. On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
  // 3. On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.
