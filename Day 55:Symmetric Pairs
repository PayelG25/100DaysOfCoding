You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.

___________________________________________
    Column       |         Type            |
_________________|_________________________|
     X           |         Integer         |
_________________|_________________________|
     Y           |         Integer         |
_________________|_________________________|


Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

Sample Output

20 20
20 21
22 23

SELECT A.X, A.Y FROM Functions AS A
    INNER JOIN Functions AS B
    WHERE (A.X = B.Y) AND (A.Y = B.X) AND (A.X < A.Y)
UNION
    SELECT X, Y FROM Functions
    GROUP BY X, Y
    HAVING (X=Y) AND (COUNT(*) > 1)
ORDER BY X;
